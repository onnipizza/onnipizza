just got hacked. the hacker changed my steam username to "xxxx" and bought some Dota 2 crap, and my discord just put a "3 months pf Discord Nitro free from STEAM" to all of my friends, but i have few friends on discord and they didn't care. i changed the username, and changed the passwords. nothing else happened.
but my microsoft account got hacked, is more worrying. the hacker changed the email to theirs. now i can't change it to my email. the email is a "mcmfa.email" domain, but there is no website for it. i could've checked it, but i'm at a dead end. there is only two options: hack the email and get the password. or contact microsoft. i did contact microsoft and nothing (yet i think). i'll put a update when microsoft notices my problem. OR just annoy the life out of them to get my account back.
